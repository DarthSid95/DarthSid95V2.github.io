Hi! I'm an interdisciplinary Ph.D. student at the [Robert Bosch Center for Cyber-Physical Systems](https://cps.iisc.ac.in) (RBCCPS) at the [Indian Institute of Science](http://iisc.ac.in), Bangalore. I work at the Spectrum Lab in the Department of Electrical Engineering, under the supervision of Prof. [Chandra Sekhar Seelamantula](https://sites.google.com/site/chandrasekharseelamantula). Previously, I was at [M.S. Ramaiah Institute of Technology](http://msrit.edu) (MSRIT), Bangalore, where I completed my Bachelors in Technology in Electronics and Communications Engineering. Check out my full [CV](/al-folio/publications/) here.

My PhD is not graciously funded by the Prime Ministers? Research Fellowship (PMRF). Please find more information about PMRF here.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
