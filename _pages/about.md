Hi! I'm an interdisciplinary Ph.D. student at the [Robert Bosch Center for Cyber-Physical Systems](https://cps.iisc.ac.in) (RBCCPS) at the [Indian Institute of Science](http://iisc.ac.in), Bangalore. I work at the Spectrum Lab in the Department of Electrical Engineering, under the supervision of Prof. [Chandra Sekhar Seelamantula](https://sites.google.com/site/chandrasekharseelamantula). Previously, I was at [M.S. Ramaiah Institute of Technology](http://msrit.edu) (MSRIT), Bangalore, where I completed my Bachelors in Engineering in Electronics and Communications Engineering. Check out my full [CV](/publications/) here or my render your [publications](publications/) here.

My research interests are broadly in the are of generative modeling, with a focus on generative adversarial networks (GANs). My Ph.D. is focussed on building theoretical foundations for analyzing GANs, and designing network architectures motivated by those finding. Recently, I've also been exploring score-based models, diffusion models, and normalizing flows as well!

Throughout my Ph.D. I've been graciously  funded by the Microsoft Research Ph.D. Fellowship in 2018, the RBCCPS Ph.D. Fellowship in 2020-2021 and 2021-2022, and the Qualcomm Innovation Fellowship in 2019, 2021, and 2022.
