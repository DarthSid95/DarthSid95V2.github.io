Hi! I'm an interdisciplinary Ph.D. student at the [Robert Bosch Center for Cyber-Physical Systems](https://cps.iisc.ac.in) (RBCCPS) at the [Indian Institute of Science](http://iisc.ac.in), Bangalore. I work at the Spectrum Lab in the Department of Electrical Engineering, under the supervision of Prof. [Chandra Sekhar Seelamantula](https://sites.google.com/site/chandrasekharseelamantula). Previously, I was at [M.S. Ramaiah Institute of Technology](http://msrit.edu) (MSRIT), Bangalore, where I completed my Bachelors in Engineering in Electronics and Communications Engineering. Check out my full [CV](/CV/) or [publications](/publications/). Amongst other things, I love [photography](/photography/) and of course, [Misty, my doggo!!](/doggo/)

My research interests are broadly in the area of generative modeling, with a focus on generative adversarial networks (GANs). My Ph.D. is on building theoretical foundations for analyzing GANs, and designing network architectures motivated by those findings. Recently, I've also been exploring links between GANs and score-based/diffusion/normalizing-flow models!

Throughout my Ph.D. I've been graciously funded by the Microsoft Research Ph.D. Fellowship in 2018, the RBCCPS Ph.D. Fellowship in 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and the Qualcomm Innovation Fellowship in 2019, 2021, and 2022.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below.
