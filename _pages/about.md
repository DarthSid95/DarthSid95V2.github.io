Hi! I'm a Research Software Development Engineer (RSDE) at the [Microsoft Research Lab](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/) (MSRI) in Bangalore, India, as part of [Manik Varma's](http://manikvarma.org/) group, and currently exploring the world of text-based generative models, in the context of [eXtreme Classification](http://manikvarma.org/downloads/XC/XMLRepository.html). Previously I was an interdisciplinary Direct-Ph.D. scholar at the [Robert Bosch Center for Cyber-Physical Systems](https://cps.iisc.ac.in) (RBCCPS) at the [Indian Institute of Science](http://iisc.ac.in), Bangalore. I work at the Spectrum Lab in the Department of Electrical Engineering, under the supervision of Prof. [Chandra Sekhar Seelamantula](https://sites.google.com/site/chandrasekharseelamantula). Even before that, I was at [M.S. Ramaiah Institute of Technology](http://msrit.edu) (MSRIT), Bangalore, where I completed my Bachelors in Engineering in Electronics and Communications Engineering. Check out my full [CV](/cv/) or [publications](/publications/). Amongst other things, I love [photography](/photography/) and [Misty, my doggo!!](/doggo/)

My research interests are broadly in the area of machine learning and generative modeling, with a focus, during my Ph.D., on generative adversarial networks (GANs). My Ph.D. was on building theoretical foundations for analyzing GANs, leveraging insights from classical signal processing, functional calculus and differential equation theory, and designing network architectures motivated by those findings. Recently, I've (like everyone else that worked with GANs) also been exploring score-based diffusion, and text-based generative models! Throughout my Ph.D. I've been graciously funded by the Microsoft Research Ph.D. Fellowship in 2018, the RBCCPS Ph.D. Fellowship in 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and the Qualcomm Innovation Fellowship in 2019, 2021, 2022 and 2023!

Looking to collaborate? It'd be great if you reached out to me at (FirstLetterOfFirstName)(LastName)(at)microsoft(dot)com

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
